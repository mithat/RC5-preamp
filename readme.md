RC5-preamp
==========
_Because remote controlled audio is free and for the people.â„¢_

RC5-preamp is an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) sketch that tries to make integrating basic remote control functionality into audio preamplifier projects fun and 
painless.

Requirements
------------
You will need an [Arduino Uno](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno), 
Guy Carpenter's [RC5 library](https://github.com/guyc/RC5), an IR remote 
control that can send RC5 preamplifier commands, and supporting hardware as 
documented below. (I used an 
[RCA RCRN08GR](http://www.rcaaudiovideo.com/remotes/6-8-devices/?sku=RCRN08GR) 
universal remote during development.)

RC5-preamp was built using the Arduino 1.6.1 framework. Other versions may work 
but are not supported.

Use
-----
Descriptions of each I/O pin are given below. Consult `config.h` for pin
mappings.

All inputs and outputs are, in Arduino parlance, 'digital'.

### User interface connections

Pin name           | Type         | Function
------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------
`VOL_UP_SWITCH`    | input switch | When pressed, pulses `VOL_UP_PIN` and sets `MUTE_PIN` `LOW`.
`VOL_DN_SWITCH`    | input switch | When pressed, pulses `VOL_DN_PIN` and sets `MUTE_PIN` `LOW`.
`SOURCE_UP_SWITCH` | input switch | When pressed, pulses `SOURCE_UP_PIN`.
`SOURCE_DN_SWITCH` | input switch | When pressed, pulses `SOURCE_DN_PIN`.
`MUTE_SWITCH`      | input switch | Toggles mute state of the system. Sets `MUTE_PIN` `HIGH` or `LOW` as needed.
`PWR_SWITCH`       | input switch | Toggles power state of the system. Sets `PWR_PIN` and `MUTE_PIN` `HIGH` or `LOW` as needed.
`RC_CMD_PIN`       | output       | Toggles state when a valid command is received.

The out-of-the-box configuration uses internal pullups on the switched inputs 
and assumes normally open momentary contact switches. There is no need to 
debounce the switches if they settle within about 20 ms (defined in 
`config.h`).

Note that if you want to use `RC_CMD_PIN` to flash an LED when a remote control 
command is received, you'll need to trigger the LED on both rising and falling 
edges.

### Other I/O

Pin name           | Type   | Function
------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------
`IR_PIN 2`         | input  | Pin to which an IR decoder module connects.
`VOL_UP_PIN`       | output | Pulses high when volume should increase.
`VOL_DN_PIN`       | output | Pulses high when volume should decrease.
`SOURCE_UP_PIN`    | output | Pulses high when input should cycle to the next input source.
`SOURCE_DN_PIN`    | output | Pulses high when input should cycle to the previous source.
`MUTE_PIN`         | output | High when system should mute, low otherwise.
`PWR_PIN`          | output | High when system power is the on state, low otherwise.

The IR decoder module should use a
[36 kHz carrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC-5#Protocol_Details). The 
[Vishay TSOP34136](http://www.vishay.com/docs/82490/tsop321.pdf)
seems to work well. While a 36 kHz carrier is specified by the RC5 protocol,
your particular remote may actually use a 38 kHz or other carrier. Be aware of 
this if things are not quite working as expected.

`VOL_UP_PIN` and `VOL_DN_PIN` will each pulse for about 150 ms on a 
corresponding event. You should be able to connect `VOL_UP_PIN` and 
`VOL_DN_PIN` to a motorized potentiometer through an 
[H-bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge) or to a digital 
potentiometer through appropriate glue logic.

_Don't attempt to use `VOL_UP_PIN` and `VOL_DN_PIN` to drive a motorized 
potentiometer directly!_ It won't work and you may fry your Arduino.

If you use a digital potentiometer, you'll need to implement the logic in front
of it that senses the command pulses and delivers the appropriate control
signals to the digital potentiometer.

`SOURCE_UP_PIN` and `SOURCE_DN_PIN` will each pulse for about 150 ms on a
corresponding event. The input selection circuitry is expected to cycle through
inputs on each pulse it receives.

The `MUTE_PIN` can be used to control a digital volume potentiometer's 
attenuation or an additional muting circuit.

Since RC5-preamp wants to be on continuously (see **Behavior** below), it's 
expected that you'll use `PWR_PIN` to control the power delivered to the rest 
of the preamp--possibly via relay switching of a separate mains power 
transformer.

### Behavior
RC5-preamp was designed to be powered up continuously, even when the preamp is 
off. Doing otherwise would make powering on the system via remote control a 
mite tricky.

RC5-preamp does not remember the state of the system when the power is cycled 
or when the Arduino is reset. On power-up/reset, `PWR_PIN` will be `LOW`
(i.e., power off) and `MUTE_PIN` will be in a `LOW` (i.e., umnuted) state.

A power button press or remote control signal toggles `PWR_PIN` `HIGH` (on) or 
`LOW` (off).  When in the off state, RC5-preamp is inhibited from processing 
commands other than power button and remote control signal. `PWR_PIN` can be 
used to control the main power delivered to the preamp--possibly via relay
control.

When in the off state, the system mutes (`MUTE_PIN` is `HIGH`), and it unmutes
(`MUTE_PIN` is `LOW`) when in the on state.

Volume up/down button presses or remote control signals will pulse the 
`VOL_UP_PIN` or `VOL_DN_PIN` outputs (whichever is appropriate) for
about 150 ms on each press. Holding down any of these of these will pulse
the appropriate output about every 150 ms. If the system is muted when a 
volume up/down even happens, it will be unmuted.

A mute button press or remote control signal will toggle the mute state of the
system.

Source up/down button presses or source up remote control signals will pulse
the `SOURCE_UP_PIN` or `SOURCE_DN_PIN` outputs (whichever is appropriate) for
about 150 ms on each press. Holding down the remote control source up button
will cause the pulse to repeat about every 500 ms. Note that there is no 
remote  control source down signal. I have not found an instance of an RC5 
remote that  provides  this  functionality, nor does there appear to be a 
standard for it, so it's not implemented.

### Software 
Making sure the [RC5 library](https://github.com/guyc/RC5) is in
`../libraries`, compile and upload this project to your Arduino Uno using 
your favorite method.

For development, I used Sudar's 
[Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) and a C++ IDE. 
The project's child makefile is included in this distribution. Using
Arduino-Makefile and the child makefile is not required; the sketch should 
build just fine in the vanilla Arduino IDE.

You can use any subset of the functionality offered by RC5-preamp. However, 
you'll have to modify the source if you don't plan to use the power on/off
functionality because all other functions are inhibited when the system is in 
the off state.

With appropriate changes to the source code, you should be able adapt this 
project to other Arduinos.  If you do so, be sure to share the love. (See
