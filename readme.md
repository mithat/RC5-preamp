RC5-preamp
==========
Because remote controlled audio is free and for the people!

RC5-preamp is an Arduino-based remote control processor designed to  make it
easy to integrate basic IR remote control into any audio project.

Requirements
------------
You will need Guy Carpenter's [RC5 library](https://github.com/guyc/RC5),
supporting hardware that will be documented later, and an IR remote control that
can send RC5 preamplifier commands. I used an RCA RCRN08GR universal remote
during development.
